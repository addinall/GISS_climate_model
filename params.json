{"name":"Giss climate model","tagline":"Latest GISS climate model  Re-engineering task.","body":"LATEST GISS CLIMATE MODEL\r\n=========================\r\n\r\n### Cloned - Mark Addinall\r\n\r\nInstead of just dis-beleiving the climate models from afar, I have been studying them.  This is the 'latest' offering from GISS.  Most of the code is VERY VERY OLD and a few parameters have been tarted up.\r\n\r\nI am going to re-engineer this nonsense into a modern language and then all can see and point fingers in mirth.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to know is where all the R&D money went?\r\n\r\n----\r\n  \r\nNOTE: The full documentation on how to run the model is in doc/HOWTO.html. \r\nThis summary is not complete, and not necessarily up-to-date either.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ THE FULL DOCUMENTATION - IT REALLY WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER!\r\n\r\nThe directory tree of the modelE has the following structure:\r\n\r\n  modelE\r\n        |\r\n        |-/model   (the source code for GCM model)\r\n        |\r\n        |-/aux     (auxiliary programs such as pre- and post-processing)\r\n        |\r\n        |-/exec    (various scripts needed to compile and setup the model)\r\n        |\r\n        |-/doc     (directory for documentation)\r\n        |\r\n        |-/decks   (directory for rundecks)\r\n                |\r\n                |-<run_name_1>.R     (rundeck for the run <run_name_1>)\r\n                |\r\n                |-/<run_name_1>_bin  (directory for binaries for <run_name_1>)\r\n                |\r\n                |-/<run_name_1>      (link to directory where you setup\r\n                |                     and run <run_name_1>)\r\n                |-<run_name_2>.R\r\n                ................\r\n\r\n           Configuring the model on your local system\r\n\r\n   Intended working directory is directory modelE/decks. In this\r\ndirectory type \"gmake config\". This will create a default ~/.modelErc\r\nfile in your home directory. This should be edited so that run output,\r\nrundeck libraries etc. can be properly directed, and so that the\r\ncompile options (multiple processing, compiler name , NetCDF libraries\r\netc.)  can be set appropriately.\r\n\r\n               Compiling and running the model.\r\n\r\n   All rundecks should be created inside this directory and all \"make\"\r\ncommands should be run from there. The following is a typical example\r\nof how to compile and setup a run with the name \"my_run\":\r\n\r\n      cd decks                      # go to directory decks\r\n      gmake rundeck RUN=my_run      # create rundeck for \"my_run\"\r\n\r\nYou will need to edit the rundeck in order to choose a configuration\r\nthat is appropriate. Once that is done...\r\n\r\n      gmake gcm RUN=my_run          # compile the model for \"my_run\"\r\n      gmake setup RUN=my_run        # run setup script for \"my_run\"\r\n\r\nMake sure that you create the rundeck with \"gmake rundeck ...\" before\r\nrunning any other commands for this run, otherwise the Makefile will\r\nnot understand you. You can skip \"gmake gcm ...\" and just do \"gmake setup...\"\r\nin which case gcm will be compiled automatically.\r\nAnother command you want to run (after creating the rundeck) is:\r\n\r\n      gmake aux RUN=my_run\r\n\r\nThis will compile auxiliary programs in /aux. All the binaries (both for\r\nmodel and for auxiliary programs) are put into /decks/my_run.bin .\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of targets currently supported by Makefile:\r\n\r\n config  - copy the default .modelErc setup to your home directory.\r\n rundeck - create new rundeck\r\n depend  - create dependencies for specified rundeck\r\n gcm     - compile object files and build executable for specified rundeck\r\n aux     - compile standard auxiliary programs\r\n auxqflux- compile auxiliary programs for computing qflux\r\n auxdeep - compile auxiliary programs for setting deep ocean\r\n setup   - do setup for specified rundeck\r\n clean   - remove listings and error files\r\n vclean  - remove object files, .mod files and dependencies\r\n newstart- remove all files in the run directory\r\n exe     - compile gcm and put executable into RUN directory\r\n htmldoc - create web-based documentation for this RUN\r\n\r\nIf you run \"gmake\" without arguments it will print a short help.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
